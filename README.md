This is Eva and I'm working with Casey!

# Pairing exercise!

Upgrade this code to use dictionaries for each todo.

Add these features:

## Use dictionaries instead of strings

- Instead of storing todos as strings, store them as dictionaries like this one:

```
{
    'title': 'do the thing',
    'completed': False
}
```

## Update a todo as "completed" instead of deleting them

Instead of deleting a todo, change its "completed" property.

## Print the completed todos and the non-completed todos separately.

When you print, make your output look like this:

```
======= Pending ======
0: walk the cat
1: make dinner
======================
======= Completed ======
2: get a mohawk
======================
```

### Note: you'll need to do a little extra work to make sure the correct index is shown by the todos!
